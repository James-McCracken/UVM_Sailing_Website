The Catamounts are very excited to announce that we have hired a new coach! Caroline Patten is a Hobart
and William Smith Alum, and has a strong background in sailing. Caroline graduated in 2011 and was named an
ICSA Women's Skipper Honorable Mention All-American that year. She has numerous notable finishes throughout
her collegiate sailing career.
Though the UVM is the first college team she has coached, she brings a lot of solid experience to the table.
Her time as an ICSA sailor and a coach for various programs including Severn Sailing Association proves to
be valuable preparation for coaching the Cats.
Caroline was hired in the summer of 2015 and so far has been doing a great job with the team in her first
season working with us. She has her sights set high for the Catamounts and is determined to help us live up to
those goals. We are thrilled to have her as the leader of our team and look forward to the coming seasons under her direction.
