Considering how well known the Burlington community is for the love of outdoor sports and open-minded culture, 
it is no surprise that the Sailing Team is one of the most popular and competitive club sports at UVM. 
We compete in the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association (NEISA), 
which is undoubtedly the most competitive district in college sailing. 
The team attends an average of 4 to 6 regattas per weekend. 
While the competition for spots at top events each weekend is hot, 
the expansive schedule ensures that everyone who demonstrates commitment and hard work at practice, 
will have the opportunity to sail. Most regattas that we attend are either fleet or team racing in double-handed dinghies, 
but the team sails in a variety of sloop and single-handed regattas as well. The team is funded as a club sport through the Student 
Government Association at UVM, and fundraises actively to augment its budget each season. We were lucky enough to get a brand new fleet of 18 
FJs in the spring of 2013 and will have a beautiful new sailing facility, shared with the Lake Champlain Community Sailing Center, 
starting in the fall of next year.
