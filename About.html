        <h2>Our Team:</h2>

        <p>Considering how well known the Burlington community is for the love of outdoor sports and open-minded
            culture, it is no surprise that the Sailing Team is one of the most popular and competitive club sports at
            UVM. We compete in the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association (NEISA), which is undoubtedly the
            most competitive district in college sailing. The team attends an average of 4 to 6 regattas per weekend.
            While the competition for spots at top events each weekend is hot, the expansive schedule ensures that
            everyone who demonstrates commitment and hard work at practice, will have the opportunity to sail. Most
            regattas that we attend are either fleet or team racing in double-handed dinghies, but the team sails in a
            variety of sloop and single-handed regattas as well. The team is funded as a club sport through the Student
            Government Association at UVM, and fundraises actively to augment its budget each season. We were lucky
            enough to get a brand new fleet of 18 FJs in the spring of 2013 and will have a beautiful new sailing
            facility, shared with the Lake Champlain Community Sailing Center, starting in the fall of next year. </p>

        <h2>F.A.Q</h2>

        <h3>How long is your season?</h3>

        <p>We sail from September until November, and then begin again as soon as the ice thaws, usually in late March.
            As a substitute for lost time in March, we have a spring training trip during Spring Break, and often train
            with Boston teams on Fridays.</p>

        <h3>Does UVM offer scholarships for sailing?</h3>

        <p>The University of Vermont does not offer scholarships for sailing; in fact, under ICSA rules no sailor may
            receive financial support based on sailing ability.</p>

        <h3>What is Burlington like?</h3>

        <p>Burlington is a great town - it is in the truest essence a college town, complete with four local colleges.
            The surrounding scenery is absolutely breathtaking, and one can pursue a plethora of outdoor sports. As soon
            as the season ends, our sailors often head to the mountains to enjoy the winter season. With such great
            surroundings and such fun people, the city of Burlington is really a great place to live.</p>
